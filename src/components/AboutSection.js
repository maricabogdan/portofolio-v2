        Hello! My name is Bogdan Marica and I am web developer, web designer and
        web enthusiast. At the end of 2020, i found a website called CodeAcademy
        which have an offer for 100,000 students for free 3 months. Even I am
        study Electrical Engineering at Faculty of Engineering from Craiova, I
        was curious about programming. At that moment I didnâ€™t have any
        knowledge about codding. I found a series of courses about Web
        Development which have courses about HTML CSS, JavaScript and more.
        After that day, I found my passion. Almost everyday I started learning
        about anything which have web development in common. After 3 mounths I
        entered in a special program , sort of an internship at OSF Academy for
        Web Development, Front-End. From there I started more serios and I
        learned more frameworks like React.js, SCSS and more. For me , itâ€™s hard
        because I need to split between Job, Faculty and learning. I hope you
        enjoy my portofolio. Have a nice day! ðŸ˜Š
